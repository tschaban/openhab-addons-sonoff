# GitHub Actions Integration Guide

Complete guide for understanding, using, and customizing the GitHub Actions workflows in the Sonoff Binding Smart'nyDom Enhanced Edition.

## üéØ Overview

The project includes two main GitHub Actions workflows:
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci.yml`) - Automated testing and quality assurance
- **Release Pipeline** (`release.yml`) - Automated release creation and publishing

These workflows provide enterprise-grade automation for code quality, testing, and deployment.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

### File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

#### Automatic Triggers
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**When it runs:**
- Every push to main, master, or develop branches
- Every pull request to main or master
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

### Workflow Jobs Breakdown

#### 1. Code Quality Checks
```yaml
name: Code Quality Checks
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**What it does:**
- Validates code formatting with Spotless
- Checks Maven POM structure
- Ensures code meets OpenHAB standards

**Commands executed:**
```bash
mvn spotless:check
mvn validate
```

#### 2. Unit Tests (Matrix Strategy)
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    java: [17, 21]
  fail-fast: false
```

**What it does:**
- Runs complete test suite on Java 17 and 21
- Executes 100+ test methods across 6 test classes
- Generates detailed test reports
- Uploads test artifacts for analysis

**Key features:**
- **Parallel execution** on different Java versions
- **Comprehensive reporting** with JUnit XML
- **Artifact collection** for offline analysis
- **Fail-fast disabled** for complete coverage

#### 3. Component-Specific Tests
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    component: 
      - "SonoffCacheProvider*"
      - "SonoffHandlerFactory*" 
      - "SonoffDiscoveryService*"
```

**What it does:**
- Tests each major component independently
- Provides focused feedback on component health
- Enables parallel execution for faster results
- Isolates component failures for easier debugging

#### 4. Integration Tests
```yaml
- name: Run integration tests
  run: mvn test -Dtest="*IntegrationTest" -B
  
- name: Run error handling tests
  run: mvn test -Dtest="*ErrorHandlingTest" -B
```

**What it does:**
- Validates real-world integration scenarios
- Tests error handling and edge cases
- Verifies file system operations
- Confirms resource cleanup

#### 5. Build Verification
```yaml
- name: Compile and package
  run: mvn clean compile package -DskipTests -DskipChecks
  
- name: Verify JAR creation
  run: |
    if [ -f target/*.jar ]; then
      echo "‚úÖ JAR file created successfully"
      ls -la target/*.jar
    else
      echo "‚ùå JAR file not found"
      exit 1
    fi
```

**What it does:**
- Compiles source code without tests
- Creates deployable JAR file
- Validates build artifacts
- Uploads JAR for download

#### 6. Cross-Platform Tests
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

**What it does:**
- Verifies core functionality across platforms
- Tests Java compatibility on different OS
- Ensures consistent behavior
- Validates environment independence

#### 7. Test Summary
```yaml
- name: Display test summary
  run: |
    echo "## üß™ Test Execution Summary" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "- **Unit Tests**: ${{ needs.unit-tests.result }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

**What it does:**
- Aggregates results from all jobs
- Creates visual summary in GitHub UI
- Reports overall pipeline status
- Provides quick status overview

## üéâ Release Pipeline Workflow

### File: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

#### Automatic Triggers
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Release version (e.g., v1.0.0)'
        required: true
        type: string
```

**When it runs:**
- When you create a git tag starting with 'v' (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0`)
- Manual trigger with custom version input

### Release Jobs Breakdown

#### 1. Pre-Release Tests
**Mirrors:** `task-run-unit-tests.ps1` functionality

```yaml
- name: Run comprehensive test suite
  run: |
    echo "üß™ Running comprehensive test suite..."
    mvn spotless:apply
    mvn test -B
```

**Quality gates:**
- All tests must pass
- Code formatting must be valid
- Build must succeed

#### 2. Create Release
**Mirrors:** `task-run-deploy.ps1` functionality

```yaml
- name: Build release artifacts
  run: |
    mvn spotless:apply
    mvn test -B
    mvn clean install -DskipChecks -DskipTests
```

**What it creates:**
- GitHub release with professional notes
- JAR artifact with Smart'nyDom branding
- Download links and documentation
- Version-specific release information

#### 3. Professional Release Notes
```yaml
body: |
  ## üöÄ Sonoff Binding - Smart'nyDom Enhanced Edition ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
  
  ### üì¶ What's Included

```

## üîß Customizing Workflows

### Adding New Test Categories
```yaml
# In ci.yml, add to component-tests matrix
strategy:
  matrix:
    component: 
      - "SonoffCacheProvider*"
      - "SonoffHandlerFactory*" 
      - "SonoffDiscoveryService*"
      - "YourNewComponent*"  # Add here
```

### Modifying Java Versions
```yaml
# In ci.yml, modify unit-tests matrix
strategy:
  matrix:
    java: [17, 21, 22]  # Add Java 22
```

### Adding Notification Integrations
```yaml
# Add to end of jobs
- name: Notify Slack
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

### Custom Artifact Retention
```yaml
# Modify retention-days in upload-artifact actions
- name: Upload test results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-results
    path: target/surefire-reports/
    retention-days: 7  # Change from 30 to 7
```

## üîí Security and Secrets

### Required Secrets
The workflows use these GitHub secrets:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- No additional secrets required for basic functionality

### Optional Secrets for Enhancements
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` - For Slack notifications
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` - For Discord notifications
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - For SonarQube integration

### Setting Up Secrets
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Add name and value
4. Reference in workflow: `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
```yaml
# Maven dependency caching
- name: Cache Maven dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.m2
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-m2-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-m2
```

### Parallel Execution
- **Matrix strategies** for concurrent testing
- **Independent jobs** for parallel execution
- **Fail-fast disabled** for complete coverage
- **Component isolation** for focused testing

### Resource Management
- **Artifact retention policies** for storage optimization
- **Conditional job execution** to save resources
- **Efficient caching** for faster builds
- **Optimized Docker images** when applicable

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Conditional Execution
```yaml
# Only run on specific conditions
- name: Deploy to staging
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: echo "Deploying to staging"
```

### Environment-Specific Jobs
```yaml
# Different behavior per environment
jobs:
  test-dev:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    # Development-specific testing
    
  test-prod:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    # Production-specific testing
```

### Dynamic Matrix Generation
```yaml
# Generate matrix from file or API
strategy:
  matrix:
    include: ${{ fromJson(needs.setup.outputs.matrix) }}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Workflow Not Triggering
- **Check branch names** in trigger configuration
- **Verify push permissions** for the repository
- **Review workflow file syntax** for YAML errors

#### Test Failures
- **Review job logs** for specific error messages
- **Check test reports** in artifacts
- **Verify local test execution** before pushing
