## üìñ About This Binding

The Sonoff binding allows control and monitoring of eWeLink-based devices using both cloud and local LAN connections. This enhanced version extends the original functionality with additional device support and improved reliability.

### üåê Connection Modes
- **Cloud Mode** - Connect through eWeLink cloud services
- **Local Mode** - Direct LAN communication (where supported)
- **Mixed Mode** - Automatic fallback between local and cloud

### üîå Supported Things

Currently known to support (non-exhaustive list):

#### Mixed Mode Support (Local + Cloud)
- **UUID1:** S20, S26, Basic, Mini, Mini PCIe Card
- **UUID2:** Unknown Models
- **UUID3:** Unknown Models
- **UUID4:** Unknown Models
- **UUID5:** POW
- **UUID6:** T11C, TX1C, G1
- **UUID7:** T12C, TX2C
- **UUID8:** T13C, TX3C
- **UUID9:** Unknown Models
- **UUID15:** TH10, TH16
- **UUID28:** RFBRIDGE (Only sensors currently supported, awaiting remote logs)
- **UUID32:** POWR2
- **UUID77:** MICRO USB

#### Cloud Only Support
- **UUID24:** 1 Channel GSM Socket
- **UUID27:** 1 Channel GSM Socket
- **UUID29:** 2 Channel GSM Socket
- **UUID30:** 3 Channel GSM Socket

- **UUID2026:** Zigbee Motion Sensor

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Initial Configuration
1. **Add Account Thing**
   - Email: Your eWeLink email address
   - Password: Your eWeLink password
   - Access Mode: Choose your preferred mode (`local`, `cloud`, or `mixed`)

2. **Run Discovery**
   - The account should come online automatically
   - Run discovery to create device cache
   - Cache is required even when using text files

3. **Add Devices**
   - Use automatic discovery (recommended)
   - Or manually add via text files after cache creation

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue:** If using text files and devices don't come online after config changes, remove and re-add the file. In rare cases, you may need to remove and re-add the binding.

## üîç Discovery

- **Initial Discovery:** Run after account setup to create device cache
- **Automatic Discovery:** All devices support automatic discovery
- **Sub-devices:** For RF Bridge or Zigbee bridge sensors, add the main device first, then run discovery again

## üåç Local vs Cloud Operation

### Local Mode Benefits
- **Faster response** - Direct LAN communication
- **Privacy** - No external internet dependency
- **Firewall friendly** - Block external access while maintaining functionality

### Device Compatibility
- **Local Supported:** Most switches, POW devices, RF Bridge
- **Cloud Only:** Zigbee Bridge, GSM sockets, some sensors
- **Mixed Mode:** Automatically uses local when available, falls back to cloud

### POW/POWR2 Special Configuration

**Local Mode Energy Data:**
- Enable Local Polling: On/Off
- Polling Interval: Seconds between polls (not required in LAN Development mode)

**Cloud Mode Consumption Data:**
- Enable Consumption Polling: On/Off
- Polling Interval: Recommended 24 hours (86400 seconds) for consumption data

> **üí° Performance Tip:** Consumption data polling is resource-intensive. Use longer intervals (24+ hours) for consumption statistics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Examples
