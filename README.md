## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Initial Configuration
1. **Add Account Thing**
   - Email: Your eWeLink email address
   - Password: Your eWeLink password
   - Access Mode: Choose your preferred mode (`local`, `cloud`, or `mixed`)

2. **Run Discovery**
   - The account should come online automatically
   - Run discovery to create device cache
   - Cache is required even when using text files

3. **Add Devices**
   - Use automatic discovery (recommended)
   - Or manually add via text files after cache creation

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue:** If using text files and devices don't come online after config changes, remove and re-add the file. In rare cases, you may need to remove and re-add the binding.

## üîç Discovery

- **Initial Discovery:** Run after account setup to create device cache
- **Automatic Discovery:** All devices support automatic discovery
- **Sub-devices:** For RF Bridge or Zigbee bridge sensors, add the main device first, then run discovery again

## üåç Local vs Cloud Operation

### Local Mode Benefits
- **Faster response** - Direct LAN communication
- **Privacy** - No external internet dependency
- **Firewall friendly** - Block external access while maintaining functionality

### Device Compatibility
- **Local Supported:** Most switches, POW devices, RF Bridge
- **Cloud Only:** Zigbee Bridge, GSM sockets, some sensors
- **Mixed Mode:** Automatically uses local when available, falls back to cloud

### POW/POWR2 Special Configuration

**Local Mode Energy Data:**
- Enable Local Polling: On/Off
- Polling Interval: Seconds between polls (not required in LAN Development mode)

**Cloud Mode Consumption Data:**
- Enable Consumption Polling: On/Off
- Polling Interval: Recommended 24 hours (86400 seconds) for consumption data

> **üí° Performance Tip:** Consumption data polling is resource-intensive. Use longer intervals (24+ hours) for consumption statistics.
